Shamshuddin’s father died when he was young, and he lived with his mother and sister until their house washed away. (The following account was corroborated by family members and former neighbors).

        Our land was eroded by the river gradually. When it completely grabbed our land, we took shelter in our aunt’s house. She said “I have a husband, children and a family of my own. You can stay here for one month. Then you have to leave.” My mother said “Okay, it’s fine. We will find a way by the end of this month and go.”

Shamshuddin’s sister was the first to leave, traveling directly to Dhaka. In Bhola, it’s common for young women to migrate to Dhaka alone, according to migration researchers. Once these women find work, their families join them in the city.         <!-- <div class="title">Donia: a Temporary Respite</div> -->

By the end of the month, my sister had found a home.

She worked in a garments factory. She sent some money every month, but it wasn’t enough. My sister told my mother to come Dhaka since we had lost all our property in Bhola. She said “If you come to Dhaka others might get a job and I won’t need to send money. We can live here easily.” We had no resources at that time. So we were bound to leave Bhola and to come to Dhaka looking for work.

<br><br><br><br><br><br>Shamshuddin’s aunt was true to her word: she let the refugees stay for a month. When their time was up, Shamshuddin and his mother collected their savings, packed up their bags, and headed for Dhaka.

        Shamshuddin is not alone. His path was traced by X migrants from Bhola, according to data TKTK. Bhola is especially vulnerable as it sits in a delta between rivers, and has suffered one of the highest rates of erosion throughout Bangladesh. <br><br><br><br><br>

        Millions of migrants across Bangladesh are tracing paths like Shamshuddin's. <br><br> Pushed off their land by flooding and erosion, they are striving towards a precarious life, often in the capital of Dhaka.
