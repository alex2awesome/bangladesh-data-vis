        [DRAFT TEXT]. Shamshuddin's voyage, starting in c. 1981, would take him across a country, up a river and between two slums. He would suffer arson and displacement, bulldozing, and strained familial relations.<br><br>In traving his steps, we see a struggle and a journey that millions are facing as the result of climate-change related flooding, erosion and changing ways of life.<br><br>

        <div class="title">Elisha Village: A family home.</div>
        <br><br>
        Lush fields of grain border the Meghna river in Elisha, the small farming village on Bhola Island where Shamshuddin's family built their existence over generations.<br/><br/>Shamshuddin was born here in the 1970s and grew up helping his parents farm the land. In a single flood it was gone.<br><br>

        <div class="title">Donia: a Temporary Respite</div>
        <br><br>
        Like many Bangladeshis whose lives have been cast into confusion, Shamshuddin's first stop after being displaced was nearby: he moved in with relatives in the nearby town of Donia. <br><br>However, after 2 years, life was becoming increasingly strained. His relative's hospitality was running thin, and Shamshuddin wasn't able to earn enough to survive. <br><br>

        <div class="title">Elisha Ferry Terminal: Moving Onward</div>
        <br><br>Following the footsteps of his sister, who had left for Dhaka years before, Shamshuddin made his way towards Elisha Ferry terminal.

        <br><br>All he had was his meager possessions and a ticket for the ferry, which would take him further up the Mangha into the sprawling capital of Bangladesh. <br><br>

        <div class="title">Sadarghat: Urban slums.</div>
        <br><br>When Shamshuddin first arrived at Dhaka, he settled into Sadarghat, part of the swelling slum areas around the city.
        <br><br>His stay was short, though. Private developers and government officials often conspire to eject slum residents: slum are routinely bulldozed to service claims of promoting the law. When this doesn't work, intentional arson is often committed. Although never proven or recorded, slum residents repeatedly say that the arsen is a tactic to evict them, forcing them to start over again.
        <br><br>Shamshuddin's meager slum burned only months after moving in. With nowhere to go, fearing his life and distrustful of local authorities, he moved onwards.<br><br>

        <div class="title">Bhola Bosti: Time to Rebuild.</div>
        Shamshuddin's final stop was yet another of Dhaka's slums. Here, he was able to find employment as a security guard at a local apartment building.<br><br>He has been living here for years, despite being a renter and facing instability and insecurity daily.<br><br>

        <div class="title">Migrants from Bhola.</div>
        Shamshuddin is not alone. His path was traced by X migrants from Bhola, according to data TKTK. Bhola is especially vulnerable as it sits in a delta between rivers, and has suffered one of the highest rates of erosion throughout Bangladesh. <br><br><br><br><br>

        <div class="title">Migration in Bangladesh</div>
        Millions of migrants across Bangladesh are tracing paths like Shamshuddin's. <br><br> Pushed off their land by flooding and erosion, they are striving towards a precarious life, often in the capital of Dhaka.
